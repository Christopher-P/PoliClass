2 every additional carveout reduces public safety procrime cotton and his allies either dont understand or dont care
tom cotton is wrong about the the reasons are release without programming is worse for public
tom cotton is on the wrong side of the facts and history opinion
we can only hope tom cottons scare tactics do not ruin the potential for lifechanging crimereducing reform before his

he proposed small business tax cuts and help for veterans gop blocked those proposals also forget obamacare was essentially romneycare and cap trade was heritage foundation answer to the climate crisis his program boasted many moderate gop ideas but gop slammed him
today i partner with our fellow black conservatives for a united purpose we will
to me prison reform is not about being partisan it is about the people i personally know that were affected by
finally we need to ask a question other conservatives have asked is this real opposition or something else because
and let us not forget that already showed his opposition to be fraudulent he supports full mens rea
so every single time says dangerous or doj says without programming is more
14 this incentive structure is in fact why so many law enforcement organizations support the bill
13 this was in fact the entire premise at the core of the first step act
12 it might be exciting to for instance find out you get some commissary benefits a few packs of ramen noodles
11 mr cotton might respond that programming will still be available for other people incarcerated in federal prisons
listening and also my friends scroll up
10 every single time tom cotton calls for a carveout or for people to be excluded he is actually calling for more
9 and that last evidence highlights a particularly unfortunate trick mr cottton keeps playing the does
8 and there is more as i suggested before the research of suggests that there is no marginal utility of
7 for all these categories the same is true lots of evidence incapacitation particularly long incapacitation has poor
6 so what mr cotton proposes maintaining longer sentences evidence suggests makes people more not less dangerous
5 despite this fact the reductions are still very modest but the public safety benefits of programming as the result
4 in fact there is no evidence suggesting that the difference between the reduced time and longer sentence results in
3 in fact for the people mr cotton likes to fearmonger the most remaining in prison without programming is an
2 mr cotton likes to use scaretactics he says the will let scary people out these people will
easy breakdown of why tom cotton is not only wrong but dangerously wrong on the the act is

care what you think of the presidentit cannot bleed over to the fbicomey is confirming there is bias in the swecker
james comey just totally exposed his partisan stance by urging his fellow democrats to take back the white house in 2020 in other words he is and has been a democrat comey had no right heading the fbi at any time but especially after his mind exploded
fake news has it purposely wrong many over ten are vying for and wanting the white house chief of staff position why someone want one of the truly great and meaningful jobs in washington please report news correctly thank you
very productive conversations going on with china watch for some important announcements
great job by michael anton on a true national security expert
people do not yet realize how much of the wall including really effective renovation has already been built if the democrats do not give us the votes to secure our country the military will build the remaining sections of the wall they know how important it is
i look forward to my meeting with chuck schumer nancy pelosi in 2006 democrats voted for a wall and they were right to do so today they no longer want border security they will fight it at all cost and nancy must get votes for speaker but the wall will get built
however for strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left do not want border security they want open borders for anyone to come in this brings large scale crime and disease our southern border is now secure and will remain that way
ice border patrol and our military have done a fantastic job of securing our southern border a great wall would be however a far easier less expensive solution we have already built large new sections fully renovated others making them like new the democrats
despite the large caravans that were forming and heading to our country people have not been able to get through our newly built walls makeshift walls fences or border patrol officers military they are now staying in mexico or going back to their original countries
fbi director james comey under fire for his testimony acknowledging he knew that the democrats paid for that phony trump details on tuesday night
james behind closed doors testimony reveals that was not evidence of campaign with russia when he left the fbi in other words the witch hunt is illegal and should never have been started
which it was not but even if it was it is only a civil case like but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine liability if he made a mistake not me cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced witch hunt
find a smocking gun tying the trump campaign to russia after james testimony no smocking gunno because there was no collusion so now the dems go to a simple private transaction wrongly call it a campaign contribution
i am in the process of interviewing some really great people for the position of white house chief of staff fake news has been saying with certainty it was nick ayers a spectacular person who will always be with our agenda i will be making a decision soon
the trump administration has accomplished more than any other us administration in its first two not even years of existence we are having a great time doing it all of this despite the fake news media which has gone totally out of its mindtruly the enemy of the people
james comey must have set a record for who lied the most to congress in one day his friday testimony was so untruthful this whole deal is a rigged fraud headed up by dishonest people who would do anything so that i could not become president they are now exposed
on 245 occasions former fbi director james comey told house investigators he know recall or remember things when asked opened investigations on 4 americans not 2 know who signed off and know christopher steele all lies
it was my honor to attend in philadelphia a great game played all around by our heroes congratulations on the win
great honor to be headed to the armynavy game today will be there shortly landing now
left and right he then woke up from his dream screaming that he lied next time i go to vietnam i will ask to travel with me

very sad day night in paris maybe time to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive paris agreement and return money back to the people in the form of lower taxes the us was way ahead of the curve on that and the only major country where emissions went down last year
is collusion illusion there is no smoking gun here at this late date after all that we have gone through after millions have been spent we have no russian collusion there is nothing impeachable time for the witch hunt to end
i am thankful to both of these incredible men for their service to our country date of transition to be determined
i am pleased to announce my nomination of fourstar general mark milley chief of staff of the united states army as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff replacing general joe dunford who will be retiring
after two years and millions of pages of documents and a cost of over $30000000 no collusion
the idea of a european military work out too well in ww i or 2 but the us was there for you and always will be all we ask is that you pay your fair share of nato germany is paying 1% while the us pays 43% of a much larger gdp to protect europe fairness
the paris agreement working out so well for paris protests and riots all over france people do not want to pay large sums of money much to third world countries that are questionably run in order to maybe protect the environment chanting want love france
this afternoon president trump delivered remarks at the 2018 project safe neighborhoods national conference where he
totally clears the president thank you
it is being reported that leakin james comey was told by department of justice attorneys not to answer the most important questions total bias and corruption at the highest levels of previous administration force him to answer the questions under oath
hopefully mitch mcconnell will ask for a vote on criminal justice reform it is extremely popular and has strong bipartisan support it will also help a lot of people save taxpayer dollars and keep our communities safe go for it mitch
mike pompeo is doing a great job i am very proud of him his predecessor rex tillerson have the mental capacity needed he was dumb as a rock and i get rid of him fast enough he was lazy as hell now it is a whole new ballgame great spirit at state
president trump delivers remarks at the 2018 project safe neighborhoods national conference
and one of the most highly respected lawyers and legal minds in the country he will be a great addition to our team i look forward to having him join our very successful administration
i am pleased to announce that i will be nominating the honorable william p barr for the position of attorney general of the united states as the former ag for george hw bush
i am pleased to announce that heather nauert spokeswoman for the united states department of state will be nominated to serve as united nations ambassador i want to congratulate heather and thank ambassador nikki haley for her great service to our country
we will be doing a major counter report to the mueller report this should never again be allowed to happen to a future president of the united states
today we honor those who perished 77 years ago at pearl harbor and we salute every veteran who served in world war ii over the 4 years that followed that horrific attack god bless america
it has been incorrectly reported that rudy giuliani and others will not be doing a counter to the mueller report that is fake news already 87 pages done but obviously cannot complete until we see the final witch hunt report
china talks are going very well
the lying and leaking by the people doing the report also bruce ohr and his lovely wife molly comey brennan clapper all of the many fired people of the fbi be listed in the report will the corruption within the dnc clinton campaign be exposedand so much more
foundation be listed at the top of the report will the scathing document written about james comey by the man in charge of the case rod rosenstein who also signed the fisa warrant be a big part of the report rod therefore totally conflicted will all of
overturned 90 in the united states supreme court doing same thing to people now will all of the substantial many contributions made by the 17 angry democrats to the campaign of crooked hillary be listed in top of report will the people that worked for the clinton
will robert big time conflicts of interest be listed at the top of his republicans only report will andrew horrible and vicious prosecutorial past be listed in the report he wrongly destroyed lives took down great companies only to be
robert mueller and james comey are best friends just one of many mueller conflicts of interest and bye the way the woman in charge of prosecuting jerome corsi who i do not know in charge of at the corrupt clinton foundation a total witch hunt
arizona together with our military and border patrol is bracing for a massive surge at a nonwalled area we will not let them through big danger nancy and chuck must approve boarder security and the wall
fake news the enemy of the people
trish_regan the fbi follow protocol to obtain the fisa warrant i think so the dossier was opposition research funded by opponents use government resources to take down political foes weaponizing government for is this really america witch hunt
jerome corsi is not justice this is not america this is a political prosecution the special prosecutor counsel to get this plea deal demanded i lie and violate the law the he is not alone 17 angry dems people forced to lie sad
statement from china teams of both sides are now having smooth communications and good cooperation with each other we are full of confidence that an agreement can be reached within the next 90 i agree
does the fake news media ever mention the fact that republicans with the very important help of my campaign rallies won the united states senate 53 to 47 all i hear is that the open border dems won the house senate alone approves judges others big republican win
my thoughts and prayers are with the crew members who were involved in a midair collision off the coast of japan thank you to for their immediate response and rescue efforts whatever you need we are here for you
without the phony russia witch hunt and with all that we have accomplished in the last almost two years tax regulation cuts military vets etc my approval rating would be at 75% rather than the 50% just reported by rasmussen called presidential harassment
doug wead a truly great presidential historian had a wonderful take on a very beautiful moment in history the funeral service today of president bush doug was able to brilliantly cover some very important and interesting periods of time
hopefully opec will be keeping oil flows as is not restricted the world does not want to see or need higher oil prices
looking forward to being with the bush family this is not a funeral this is a day of celebration for a great man who has led a long and distinguished life he will be missed
considered to be the worst and most dangerous addictive and deadly substance of them all last year over 77000 people died from fentanyl if china cracks down on this using the death penalty for distributors and pushers the results will be incredible
one of the very exciting things to come out of my meeting with president xi of china is his promise to me to criminalize the sale of deadly fentanyl coming into the united states it will now be considered a this could be a game changer on what is
very strong signals being sent by china once they returned home from their long trip including stops from argentina not to sound naive or anything but i believe president xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting all subjects discussed
china had agreed to start buying us
officially echoed president donald optimism over bilateral trade talks chinese officials have begun preparing to restart imports of us soybeans liquified natural gas the first sign confirming the claims of president donald trump and the white house that
china does not want tariffs
we are either going to have a real deal with china or no deal at all at which point we will be charging major tariffs against chinese product being shipped into the united states ultimately i believe we will be making a deal either now or into the future
in the world i want clean air and clean water and have been making great strides in improving environment but american taxpayers and american workers pay to clean up others pollution
i am glad that my friend and the protestors in paris have agreed with the conclusion i reached two years ago the paris agreement is fatally flawed because it raises the price of energy for responsible countries while whitewashing some of the worst polluters
there are riots in socialist france because of radical leftist fuel barely mentioning is
could somebody please explain to the democrats we need their votes that our country losses 250 billion dollars a year on illegal immigration not including the terrible drug flow top border security including a wall is $25 billion pays for itself in two months get it done
but if a fair deal is able to be made with china one that does all of the many things we know must be finally done i will happily sign let the negotiations begin make america great again
i am a tariff man when people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our nation i want them to pay for the privilege of doing so it will always be the best way to max out our economic power we are right now taking in $billions in tariffs make america rich again
on seeing whether or not a real deal with china is actually possible if it is we will get it done china is supposed to start buying agricultural product and more immediately president xi and i want this deal to happen and it probably will but if not remember
the negotiations with china have already started unless extended they will end 90 days from the date of our wonderful and very warm dinner with president xi in argentina bob lighthizer will be working closely with steve mnuchin larry kudlow wilbur ross and peter navarro
looking forward to being with the wonderful bush family at blair house today the former first lady will be coming over to the white house this morning to be given a tour of the christmas decorations by melania the elegance precision of the last two days have been remarkable

looking forward to being with the bush family to pay my respects to president george hw bush
bob mueller who is a much different man than people think and his out of control band of angry democrats want the truth they only want lies the truth is very bad for their mission
will never testify against this statement was recently made by roger stone essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about nice to know that some people still have
his wife and fatherinlaw who has the money off scott free he lied for this outcome and should in my opinion serve a full and complete sentence
cohen asks judge for no prison you mean he can do all of the terrible unrelated to trump things having to do with fraud big loans taxis etc and not serve a long prison term he makes up stories to get a great already reduced deal for himself and get
we would save billions of dollars if the democrats would give us the votes to build the wall either way people will not be allowed into our country illegally we will close the entire southern border if necessary also stop the drugs
i am certain that at some time in the future president xi and i together with president putin of russia will start talking about a meaningful halt to what has become a major and uncontrollable arms race the us spent 716 billion dollars this year crazy
president xi and i have a very strong and personal relationship he and i are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change on trade and far beyond between our two great nations a solution for north korea is a great thing for china and all
farmers will be a a very big and fast beneficiary of our deal with china they intend to start purchasing agricultural product immediately we make the finest and cleanest product in the world and that is what china wants farmers i love you
my meeting in argentina with president xi of china was an extraordinary one relations with china have taken a big leap forward very good things will happen we are dealing from great strength but china likewise has much to gain if and when a deal is completed level the field
china has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into china from the us currently the tariff is 40%
this week jews around the world will celebrate the miracles of hanukkah melania and i send our very best wishes for a blessed and happy hanukkah

billions of dollars are pouring into the coffers of the usa because of the tariffs being charged to china and there is a long way to go if companies want to pay tariffs build in the usa otherwise lets just make our country richer than ever before
when will this illegal joseph mccarthy style witch hunt one that has shattered so many innocent lives ever endor will it just go on forever after wasting more than $40000000 is that possible it has proven only one thingthere was no collusion with russia so ridiculous
did you ever see an investigation more in search of a crime at the same time mueller and the angry democrats even looking at the atrocious and perhaps subversive crimes that were committed by crooked hillary clinton and the democrats a total disgrace
general motors is very counter to what other auto and other companies are doing big steel is opening and renovating plants all over the country auto companies are pouring into the us including bmw which just announced a major new plant the usa is booming
so much happening with the now discredited witch hunt this total hoax will be studied for years

the reason that the small truck business in the us is such a go to favorite is that for many years tariffs of 25% have been put on small trucks coming into our country it is called the if we did that with cars coming in many more cars would be built here
wow if a conservative said this they would be boycotted and not allowed back in the public arena hillary said

illegals can get up to $3874 a month under federal assistance program our social security checks are on average
if gm doesnt want to keep their jobs in the united states they should pay back the $112 billion bailout that was

brenda snipes in charge of voting in broward county florida was just spotted wearing a beautiful dress with 300 i voted signs on it just kidding she is a fine very honorable and highly respected voting tactician
the mueller witch hunt is a total disgrace they are looking at supposedly stolen crooked hillary clinton emails even though they want to look at the dnc server but have no interest in the emails that hillary deleted acid washed after getting a congressional subpoena
for electric cars general motors made a big china bet years ago when they built plants there and in mexico think that bet is going to pay off i am here to protect workers
very disappointed with general motors and their ceo mary barra for closing plants in ohio michigan and maryland nothing being closed in mexico china the us saved general motors and this is the thanks we get we are now looking at cutting all subsidies including
polls are open in mississippi we need cindy hydesmith in washington go out and vote thanks

republicans and democrats must come together finally with a major border security package which will include funding for the wall after 40 years of talk it is finally time for action fix the border for once and for all now

we no longer pay pakistan the $billions because they would take our money and do nothing for us bin laden being a prime example afghanistan being another they were just one of many countries that take from the united states without giving anything in return ending
of course we should have captured osama bin laden long before we did i pointed him out in my book just before the attack on the world trade center president clinton famously missed his shot we paid pakistan billions of dollars they never told us he was living there fools

care how many lives the ruin these are angry people including the highly conflicted bob mueller who worked for obama for 8 years they even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side a total witch hunt like no other in american history
the inner workings of the mueller investigation are a total mess they have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts they are screaming and shouting at people horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want they are a disgrace to our nation and

the prospect of presidential harassment by the dems is causing the stock market big headaches
the florida election should be called in favor of rick scott and ron desantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere and many ballots are missing or forged an honest vote count is no longer possibleballots massively infected must go with election night
of money spent on protecting other countries and we get nothing but trade deficits and losses it is time that these very rich countries either pay the united states for its great military protection or protect themselvesand trade must be made free and fair

happy 243rd birthday to our great us marine
i am in paris getting ready to celebrate the end of world war one is there anything better to celebrate than the end of a war in particular that one which was one of the bloodiest and worst of all time
there is no reason for these massive deadly and costly forest fires in california except that forest management is so poor billions of dollars are given each year with so many lives lost all because of gross mismanagement of the forests remedy now or no more fed payments
mr whitaker is very highly thought of by senator ambassador leonard leo of federalist society and many more i feel certain he will make an outstanding acting attorney general
matthew g whitaker is a highly respected former us attorney from iowa he was chosen by jeff sessions to be his chief of staff i did not know mr whitaker likewise as chief i did not know mr whitaker except primarily as he traveled with ag sessions no social contact
president macron of france has just suggested that europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the us china and russia very insulting but perhaps europe should first pay its fair share of nato which the us subsidizes greatly
just out in arizona signatures match electoral corruption call for a new election we must protect our democracy
thank you for helping to expose the potential corruption going on with respect to election theft in broward and palm beach counties the world is now watching closely
in the 2016 election i was winning by so much in florida that broward county which was very late with vote tabulation and probably getting ready to do a do it because not enough people live in broward for them to falsify a victory
mayor gillum conceded on election day and now broward county has put him into bill nelson conceded election now back in play this is an embarrassment to our country and to democracy
rick scott was up by 50000+ votes on election day now they many votes and he is only up 15000 votes broward how come they never find republican votes
jeff flakey want to protect the nonsenate confirmed special counsel he wants to protect his future after being unelectable in arizona for the of doing a terrible job a weak and ineffective guy
as soon as democrats sent their best election stealing lawyer marc elias to broward county they miraculously started finding democrat votes worry florida i am sending much better lawyers to expose the fraud

according to nbc news voters nationwide disapprove of the socalled mueller investigation 46% more than they approve 41% you mean they are finally beginning to understand what a disgusting witch hunt led by 17 angry democrats is all about
in all fairness nancy pelosi deserves to be chosen speaker of the house by the democrats if they give her a hard time perhaps we will add some republican votes she has earned this great honor
if the democrats think they are going to waste taxpayer money investigating us at the house level then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of classified information and much else at the senate level two can play that game
to any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great midterm election just remember two words fake news
i will be doing a news conference at the white house 1130 am will be discussing our success in the midterms

the francis strategy is not a new idea it is an old idea that is becoming less and less relevant moving forward if sam were alive today he would be rethinking it and moving beyond it
trumps problem is that his stupidity and bombast turn off suburban educated whites and despite his popular rallies how many working class whites are demoralized by the fact that their lives are simply not getting better while trump is out bragging about the stock market
well see what happens in 2020 but if fewer and fewer white voters go for the gop in three successive elections thats am undeniable trend
lastly donald trump has not expanded the white voting base in fact hes shrunk it in 2016 trump made inroads with every racial group save he won fewer of us than mitt romney in 2018 54% of white voters chose republican down from 60% in 2010
the thought has crossed my mind that it is the gop not the democrats that must be defeated and demoralized for something better to arise in its place
after the midterms many altright commentators yucked it up about how blacks didnt flood into the gop as grifters like candace owens promised apparently only whites can maintain their ongoing cuckoldry by republicans
the thought has crossed my mind that the gop becoming the white party has a sinister element to it whites are turned off by the democrats more and more and come running into the arms of gop cucks and conmen in the end the gop isnt the stupid the evil party
republican power in congress and the presidency has coincided with the white death demoralization breakdown of family formation indebtedness and more its tragic i praise tucker carlson for talking about this though not always in the best ways
secondly this strategy has not benefited whites working whites vote for the gop have begun to passionately hate this has not led to legislation that would actually help them this goes well beyond immigration
first off at this point the strategy seems more descriptive than prescriptive the gop has been winning as the white so the working white mans decades indeed cucks mastered the art of being implicitly white and explicitly libertarian or nonracial
im critical of the the francis strategy on a number of levels
nb no disrespect to steve sailer but if this strategy should bear anyones name it is sam francis who wrote about this explicitly and definitively in the 1990s so ill call it the francis strategy to pay respects to the great man
in 2016 so many of us including myself felt strategy was consciously being implemented by a gop presidential candidate namely donald trump
for the past 15 many in the altright writ large have pushed what is known as the sailer strategy put simply the gop is the white peoples party whether it likes it or not and it should engage in inreach to whites as opposed to outreach to minorities
we actually had relevance when we had a unique voice it going to take a long time to get that back
what we did experience was the collapse of a narrative trump is actually winning get ready for serious immigration reform soonwell lose relevance if we go against trumptrumps redpilling the normies with his tweetstrump is our real leaderetc
a month ago most of the altright was gushing about trumps prospects now its apparently okay to criticize him again changed trump his relationship to the nothing
so we suspend and reinstate our critical faculty based on the mood of twitter followers or forum posters one will take what we say seriously me out

trumps tweet did nothing to protect white farmers in south
its a genuine scandal and media failure that in discussions of migrant/refugee crises whether in europe or north america
trumps first two years in office were mitt romneys policies but with racist tweets
not gonna happen ann and the wall was always a symbol anyway not like cracking down on illegals is going to affect the demographic trajectory of america time to move on
forget that milo chimed in to also disavow the proud boys after spending months whining that
thus depressing to see gavin double down on the worst aspects of this career in in his recent video he seems to think that putting on the hat will make a bit of difference it and time to walk away from him
awfully tired of people merely blaming the media and their and reporting for the fate of the proud boys and similar gorups the media are the junior partners of the system they control it they articulate its opinions
important is that the opinion of public groups for white men has been made are strictly *verboten*
i know what will happen with the proud boys they have been demoralized but they might find the innerstrength to go on they might become more radical ideologically or adopt an even more annoying
you can do what you will this knowledge but not pretend that it true i have concluded this a year i should this is clearly the case now most tell people in the altright the truth i will
be brutally honest involved in a public altright club you should know three things you have *already* been infiltrated by antifa and/or feds if you are well known or effective you will be declared a terrorist group trump save you
no flag waving no pleas to donald trump no black girlfriends or jewish allies could save the proud boys from their original sin of being a group that appealed to and represented the interests of white men
but none of this mattered in the end the proud boys were attacked by the system because they were a a group of white or whiteish men meeting together forming bonds outside of consumerism and christian churches and behaving in badass ways
true that the proud boys did have many nonwhite members to their credit they attracted some blacks and secondgeneration immigrants who identified with the traditional american nation
from what i heard was always the leader *pace his absurd claims to the in almost totalitarian thought control of the proud boys chat rooms had who suppressed altright thoughts and heretics were swiftly expelled
the proud boys were both uncouth and impeccable very working class but then decidedly protrump and how better to appeal to the normies
the proud boys too played a double game on one hand they were more rough and tumble and ready for a fight than any altright group including twp on the other their expressed ideology was essentially neoconservatism for morons
since 2017 gavin seemed mostly to define himself as not
gavin always played a double game on one hand he was the ultimate bad boy bashing feminists and transsexuals with abandon on the other hand he was the ultimate good boy the
i cringed hearing gavin claim that his controversial statements were part of an ongoing comedy routine and that he really meant it when he acted like a conventional conservative my hope is that the exact opposite is closer to the truth
most revealing about gavin down from the proud video is that clearly learned nothing from the the whole affair
the collapse of the proud boys is civic nationalism was stigmatized as white nationalism the

the trump moment is over and its time for us to move on
trump didnt seize this moment he instead enacted paul ryans agenda throughout 201718 we got lots of hilarious tweets but policywise trumps presidency differed little from what we could have expected from jeb or marco
indeed trump misfired before he took the very people he ran against as i played out in 2016 trump basically had a year and a half to enact lasting immigration reform the midterms are always tricky and once 2019 rolls around its election season once again
in chess your opening is all important the middle game is where the action happens and the end game is decisive but if you botch your opening it is almost impossible to recover trump botched his opening
heres how i viewed trump in december hes appointing what he ran he has a year and a half to enact meaningful immigration legislation the time to be critical of him is

unless we are able to stand on our own the altright is going to become a racist version of fox news sad spectacle indeed
the altright has lived by the sword and died by it too we ascended with trump in 2016then descended into wishful thinking rationalization and cheerleading the more we facilitate trump the more we lose authenticity as a identitarian movement
trump has taken the slings and arrows of a revolutionary changeagent while not actually changing anything policywise would things be so different if jeb had been elected in 2016 not really if an actual vision i see it
if trump is going to alienate middleclass white voters with his vulgarity stupidity and he obviously policy must be swiftly implemented that actually benefits them and changes the current paradigm
a lot of sarcasm in this thread but the numbers are real and being sarcastic to prove a point
in a way trumps greatest success may be ushering in the end of belief in the american system if
while only talk about creating a postwhite gop trump has delivered results trump has successfully alienated white voters while making inroads to black and hispanic communities
in 2018 a trend emerged only 54 percent of white voters backed republicans
in 2016 donald trump increased republican gains among all race save support fell to 58 percent whereas black and hispanic support each increased by 5 points
mitt romney managed 59 percent of whites in strong showing against a popular incumbent but not enough in the current paradigm
four years lates republicans took charge of the senate again hitting that magic 60 percent figure among whites
in 2010 tea party candidates swept the a bigger wave than 60+ percent of whites
one of donald more remarkable and unheralded accomplishments has been to suppress the white vote

fourth republicanled immigration reform going to happen i a huge fan of the raise act which was proffered in 2017 however i can imagine the canadian model being advanced by democrats in the 2020s originated on the right too
third with a democratic congress trump might be more willing to do the things that i and others encouraged him to do in 201718 infrastructure national healthcare policy etc basically he should be the that he promised he would be in 2016
second trump still has a path to electoral college the victories of republicans in statewide florida races albeit razor thing indicate that he can take the state even without texas trump could cobble together enough midwestern states to win
the reason he be impeached at this point is fundamentally political the democrats want to run against him in 2020 they think with good reason that voting against trump motivates their base and suburban independents
first he will not be impeached and most certainly be convicted in the senate if the house decides to overreach he will serve out his first term which is an accomplishment in itself and he might very well be reelected

at this point trumps legislative prospects amount to a hilarious twitter feed and more cringe videos of liberals crying and shouting in the wee hours of november 10 you think trumpled immigration reform is happening id be happy to sell you the eiffel tower
thats what we need to talk about the first step is to stop cheerleading
both of the foregoing propositions can be and are true holding them in mind simultaneously and
basically my predictions as well trump is not to blame for coming recession though thats built into the business cycle
trump is the vital focal point of white consciousness and racial energy
thread is worth rereading trump simply missed his opportunity immigration reform
one positive outcome of tonight could be that people like nick stop pretending that actually been winning this past year and a half facing this reality is a first step toward maturity
instead over the course of the last year much of the altright descended into a republican cheering kind of racist version of bill mitchell and fox out of fear of not looking cool in the eyes of establishment republicans nick was hardly alone
what would have happened if the altright had in unison criticized trump for his priorities tomorrow morning a narrative would arise about how trump alienated the altright and paid the his vanguard and the intensity we can bring
if trump really wanted a wall and a reduction of legal immigration then we can only conclude that he engaged in a catastrophic miscalculation that he got played and that he mangled the art of the deal
the republican establishment never wanted 2016 agenda it made that explicitly clear in countless statements and white papers over the past decade is trump who acquiesced to establishment republicans again and appointing them to positions of influence
now after the loss of the the reality that serious immigration reform is close to impossible has been made manifestly parrots back at us what been saying for a year and a half with one difference of trump is blameless
nick invariably attacked us as blackpilled impractical wingnuts or worse who were harming agenda and blind to the fact that he was actually winning the whole time
for more than a year many serious people pointed out that trump went off the rails very early on and that he wasted his political capital and window of opportunity on paul occasionally bill instead of what he promised in 2016
nick fuentes is a literal and figurative child i point this out to needlessly jump on someone representative of a delusional way of thinking that infects the which needs to end

my initial statement on my marriage divorce and abuse allegations
i value nina as a person and mother despite the end of our marriage she and i will continue to work together as parents to do what is best for our children
also important to remember that montana law does not consider political or cultural beliefs criteria for determining a parenting plan or what is in a best interest
my counsel has requested multiple times to have the divorce file sealed to avoid this exact situation these motions were seconded by representative which leads me to believe that nina did not want her filings made public and did not push them on the press
i have sought and continue to seek an amicable end to the marriage through mediation and tried to focus on the two people who are most important our children
the suggestion that she was ever in a dangerous or abusive situation over the past decade is false the man depicted in her filings simply me
it should be noted i have attempted to make this as seamless as possible for the children and nina giving them continuity with their living situation further we celebrated holidays this past year together as a family and i could go on
indeed it was i who called the police recently when i visited my children while nina was away and was harassed by a middleaged babysitter apparently in league with nina who was secretly recording my interactions with her
at no point during our time living together did nina seek recourse with the police child protective services or any governmental organization to my knowledge
after these alleged events occurred nina elected to continue in the marriage have and raise children with me publicly defend me launch publishing projects and more as late as august of this past year nina pleaded in writing that i return to her and continue the marriage
as this process goes on i will talk about the truth i will not however engage in any mudslinging at the mother of my children
but to judge me as a man husband and father by these not look at the entirety of our life morally and factually wrong
it is not uncommon for accusations like the ones nina has made to appear in a divorce proceeding whether to secure custody of children or money or simply to exact revenge
needless to say nasty things nina has said and done throughout our marriage have been omitted
since 2016 she has been secretly recording our arguments in hope of memorializing unkind regrettable words that could be used to harm me in a situation like this
she has however engaged in a combination of cherrypicking inflating or distorting of facts and in some cases gross mischaracterizations of me in her filing
i continue to respect nina and value her as the mother of our children i know that she loves both children and cares for them
our divorce is also a private matter and i made every effort to keep it that way but now that it has been reported on by buzzfeed followed by countless other outlets i can no longer stay silent
most importantly it is stressful for our two children who have done nothing wrong and are victimized by this becoming public
this experience has been emotionally stressful for all involved it is one reason why i have temporarily stepped away from fulltime publishing and activism
since last summer we have lived apart and are in the process of obtaining a divorce throughout 2016 i separated from her on three different occasions we attempted reconciliation as many times this past year it became clear that our union simply could not continue
we have published two books together including one this fall along with many other collaborative projects
nina kouprianova and i have known each other for close to ten years and we have been married for over eight we have brought two wonderful children into the world something of which we are both immensely proud

a member of faith goldys campaign just texted me aligning with the jdl denouncing the altright and promoting a onestate solution can earn you as much as 35% in a municipal election was polling at 6% before laura loomer got on board her campaign
at the end of the day she advanced her brand many altright incels will continue to drool over the trad qt selfrespecting person should be fooled by her
a laura loomer alex jones or milo political campaign wouldnt look much different goldy took the heat for being an actual identitarian but advanced ideas that were retrograde and wrong her campaign will be remembered for her shrill yelling at opponents loomering
goldy praised kevin macdonald and myself recited the 14 words and became a fixture on various altright podcasts and livestreams she now claims that this was all a social experiment she didnt mean it no one will be fooled next time
goldy claimed that her connections to the altright were fake news but the media could be forgiven for thinking that she was one of us over the course of 2017 and especially after her firing from the rebel she more than flirted with the movement and our ideas
having an opportunity to promote basic approachable identitarianism goldy instead promoted the very worst aspects of neoconservatism and the altlite not even civic nationalism we didnt hear much about white identity but lots about a onestate solution in palestine
goldy had no chance of yet focused her campaign on issues like pot holes traffic tax cutsand zionism
faith goldy is demoralizing because she combined the very worst aspects of quixotic and pragmatic campaigns she ran a campaign that was only about her brand and proved that she has precious few ideas or ideals beyond that
and i certainly dont say this because goldy was attacked by every aspect of the legal governmental and media apparatus indeed that was the most instructive and inspiring aspect of her run
i dont say this because goldy might have made some tactical errors on the trail anyone who steps into the arena makes tactical errors which are unfairly deconstructed by various armchair quarterbacks afterwards
i dont say this because goldy lost after all one can win while losing ron paul put libertarianism on the map in 2008 and changed the trajectory of mainstream conservatism even though he had no chance of becoming president
run for toronto mayor was ultimately demoralizing didnt have to be that way once thought she could be a bridge figure im now convinced shes bridge to nowhere
what was she thinking she obviously watch your video on the two types of altright candidate and

underlying it all is simply an attack on kavanaugh as a white male the about issues like abortion or the death penalty it is a which is mostly nonviolent but extremely impactful
the hearings also became a retrospective litigation of culture which is now puritanically deemed and a bastion of despite the fact that it was to a significant degree a product of the sexual revolution
the was also major test of the ability to castrate any figure it deemed worthy of destruction with various unprovable accusations and injunctions to
the is bigger than kavanaugh and his judicial decisions bigger than roe v wade which was of secondary importance in the debate over him bigger than partisan the hearing was a culture war which is increasingly a race war
i sadly cant see the actual erickson tweet because that guy blocked me in 2015
i agree that trump is a fighter at least when he wants to be jeb probably would have pressured kavanaugh to withdraw when the heat was put on him
lets remember that kavanaugh is the type of judge who would have been nominated in a jeb bush administration nevertrumpers like erickson sense correctly that trump is fighting their battles

might happen the tucker phenomenon reminds me of glenn becks career at fox a decade ago beck was not nearly as smart and was a compete goof but he did raise issues that went off the gop script
whats happening is pretty obvious journalists are trying to force tucker to make unnecessary denouncements and back away from his independent course my sense is that the tuck wont cuck
interesting how my critique of tucker carlson is spun as an
even in 1950s america the golden age for modern conservatives the west had been dead for 150 years
i also agree thats what makes him different
i am in fact a genius and was able to discern that tuckers show has great appeal among whites and taps into their anxieties but you could say this about most popular conservatives over the decades tucker is *much* better than the rest but hes still on their wave length
i dont always retweet frame game but when i do its because hes getting at something deeply important

yes i get this but ultimately adopting and internalizing the principles one problem with conservatives is that they view liberalismegalitarianism as an enemy ideology
and i would have gotten away with if it for you meddling journalists
my thoughts on the tucker phenomenon
the is not just a gradual thing it involves a fundamental change of perspective and basic principles whether tucker will ever undergo this remain a transitional all up to him
the most charitable interpretation is that tucker is holding back to hold onto his show and seeks to gently redpill his fox audience the more critical perspective is that he is stuck in the that all conservatives have been stuck in for that last 50 years
a few years ago one could plausibly though not convincingly say that conservatives just heard of things like race realism white identity politics or identitarianism after the rise of the altright you simply argue this tucker knows
tucker has become a major public figure not simply for his talents and good humor but because he has raised the specter of nationalism national disintegration and antiwhite implicitly and increasingly explicitly
tucker scolds liberals for about as if this race talk is what causes division unrest and if all be hunkydory multiracial patriotic americans if it for those darn leftists professors who talk about race all the time
tucker attacks liberals for not upholding the values of classical liberalism allowing his conservative audience to pat themselves on the back for being good individualists i find myself ironically agreeing with his detractors tucker race is real and it
tucker presents the left as with is of course not wrong but tucker does this in the sense of holding up and the absence of racial solidarity as a norm or even as a to be racially conscious is to be wicked
that said tucker has developed a routine over the past year a which reveals his deeper principles and perspective i must admit script is starting to become it has always been insufficient
if someone were to ask me the most based interesting and impactful mainstream conservative commentator the answer is easy tucker willing go places the others and he can be sharp and witty a definite improvement over people like bill

marriage becomes a union of middleclass life partners interchangeable cogs who might as well be of the same gender the sexuality possible in the new victorian age is that of the soulless anonymous hookup arranged through an internet dating app
the result of this perverted victorianism is fear and hatred between the genders monogamy is not being attacked so much as the grand tradition of the male conquest and the camaraderie of the
christine blasey ford is the figurehead a feminist revolt which is leading to a new age of victorian prudence fills alphas with terror and one of their conquests can years later accuse them of assault and destroy their lives and symbolically castrate them
the in the sexual marketplace of and postmonogamous society just so happen to be crucial components of the democratic coalition
in both postmonogamous society and young traditionally beautiful women are the objects of desire alpha males are the both groups generates intense resentment among the aging cat ladies unattractive overweight girls and beta males and below
the dionysian experience and the culture of beerguzzling and frat brahs are real expressions of male sexuality however stupid or limiting they might be they are in their ways last stands of implicit white identity

of course the promises of the sexual revolution and were never fulfilled

the sexual revolution was rehearsed on university campuses before it fully manifested itself in wider society and here the sexual revolution became tied ironically to middleclass respectability
this promise became intertwined with the universalization of higher education which occurred at the same period was your to the middle it was also a time and place of sin and debauchery allnight keggers random hookups and general idiocy
the promise sometimes tacit sometimes explicit of the midcentury sexual revolution was polymorphous perversity or endless woodstock *after those tired oppressive rules of the patriarchy and christian monogamy were lifted all be sexually fulfilled*

in fact i like sargon and hope he sticks around the alt lite can be gateway drugs or gatekeepers first steps or shortcircuits its a balance but someone has to fill this intellectual space and sargon is a better thinker than the conservatives or maga people
a lot of young people in our movement want to destroy people by posting cringe videos or an ambiguous or regrettable tweet people have been trying to destroy me like this for years i never wanted to destroy sargon
many people opposed sargon by overwhelming him with facts about racial differences not bad of course but facts dont ultimately matter i challenged the basic underpinnings of liberalism which sargon had never really thought through it was traumatic for him
this is one of marks best commentaries insightful on the hard realities of idealistic political activism the end of the day culture is downstream of power of marks criticism of sargon hold for me too
i find it so rich when weak people on the alt lite sound off on free speech while viciously gatekeeping their own

in order to prepare a truly human future it is not enough to reject evil we must build the common good together
if we encounter jesus and our brothers and sisters every day our hearts will not dwell in the past or the future they will live in gods present moment in peace with everyone
when we allow jesus to enter our lives we discover the secret to keeping alive the flame of our spiritual life
living the encounter with jesus means allowing yourself to be turned inside out by grace every day
what would happen to us if god did not always give us the chance to start over again
if we dedicate more time to prayer our hearts will reveal the lies with which we deceive ourselves and we will find true consolation in god
in the sacrament of reconciliation we find our way back to the lord and rediscover the meaning of life
with so much to do we often neglect what is really important our spiritual lives and our relationship with god so lets stop and take time to pray
i thank all women who every day strive to build more humane and welcoming societies

not surprising that very few new medical schools are granted that accreditation because that would increase the supply of doctors and drive down their the rest here
a new medical school must by law be accredited by the in conjunction with the liaison committee on medical education
libertarians would also rescind regulations that reduce the allowed numbers of health care workers facilities certificate of need con laws have swept into 35 states effectively granting power to existing hospitals to veto the construction of new competing hospitals/clinics
inexpensive private insurance for catastrophically expensive medical conditions and a free market for routine medical care would drastically reduce most health care costs while providing dramatically better outcomes
there is no reason to require that health insurance must cover flu shots/any number of other needless mandates loading insurance policies with so many requirements merely inflates the salaries of paper shufflers rather than truly enabling better access to health care services
libertarians contend that democratic fears about scaling back role in health care are equally absurd we require car insurance policies to cover gasoline purchases or oil changes
immigrants almost across the board are a net value to the united states
the has published definitive research showing that immigrants commit crime at a lower rate than nativeborn americans are less likely to consume welfare benefits generally consume a lower value of welfare benefits when they do use such services
of building a wall and threatening the caravan of immigrants with military action we should be encouraging immigration for anyone willing to work and contribute to the said chair who is also running a campaign for mayor of
the united states has a static birth rate so the only way to bolster the working class is to allow more people from other countries to join our workforce
pensions can be shored up with higher contributions lower benefits or abnormally high investment returns but an easier way to sustain customary retirement funding is to increase the number of contributing workers
today the united states has record low unemployment we have a growing population of senior citizens and a static or declining number of workingage people pushing both public and private pension plans toward bankruptcy as more people collect than pay
who helped enable the bounty of american agriculture every wave of immigrants has helped build our prosperity without them we would not be america
from siberians who crossed the bering strait and settled north america to europeans who braved the north atlantic to chinese who came to work in the california gold mines and help build the transcontinental railroad to central and south americans
some of our more talented immigrants countless entrepreneurial minds like russian immigrant sergey brin who cofounded google have created whole new industries with hundreds of thousands of new jobs
libertarians understand that every immigrant arriving in the united states to work is also a consumer when immigrants take american jobs the economy expands and new jobs are created
libertarians take a different approach an appeal to common sense
never mind the extensive evidence of how government involvement in health care raises prices and restricts access democrats claim that if we ensure role as thirdparty payer for medical costs people will die in the streets
democrats have their own october surprise campaign this year claiming that republicans want to end access to health care
more often republicans try to scare voters about immigrant competition for jobs and welfare funding
there is a racist xenophobic component to stoking fear about immigrants from countries to the south although this is usually hinted at with silent rather than being stated outright
this election year republicans are trying to panic voters with massive publicity about the migrant caravan of hondurans guatemalans and mexicans the united states

sen wrote an oped titled time to rethink relationship with saudi arabia it is not our
a couple of libertarianleaning republicans in congress have taken steps to help end this cozy relationship with such a murderous regime rep justin amash recently introduced a bill to stop supplying and assisting with saudi attacks on yemen
his decision to write about reform and criticize the saudi regime led to his death at the hands of saudi agents
khashoggi a saudi citizen was initially a supporter of the reform plans but became disillusioned his last posthumously published column was titled the arab world needs most is free
women however are still stoned to death for adultery under the extreme wasabi religious beliefs that are the law of the land for believers and nonbelievers alike and perceived enemies of the monarchy are imprisoned
prince salman has conducted a charm offensive in recent months touting increased liberalization under the rule such as recently allowing women to drive cars
ever since then both democrats and republicans have remained united in ensuring that this faustian bargain is not disturbed its longterm results continuing us involvement in middle east tribal warfare and inflation at home
after former president richard nixon cut the last remaining tie of the us dollar to gold in 1971 he had secretary of state henry kissinger negotiate a deal with the saudi royals for its nation to price its oil in dollars in exchange for us defense of the saudi throne
war in yemen is effectively a proxy war between saudi arabia iran and the battle between iran saudi arabia for middle east hegemony is really about tribal warfare between shiite sunni muslims which has been going on for millennia we have a dog in that
saudis use those weapons purchased from us defense contractors to kill women and children in said
important to remember that the saudiled war in yemen has killed more than 16000 civilians in the past few years including bombing raids on refugee camps selling more weapons to saudi arabia ensures the slaughter of far more innocent
i would love if he trump also indicated that he consider canceling a recent $110 billion arms sale to saudi arabia the largest order in trump said give that up would hurt us far more than it hurts
not looking good when asked about prince involvement in an interview with the said has told me responsible nobody has told me not responsible we reached that continues
question is whether that will cause the dinosaur parties that control dc to make changes in our decadeslong alliance with the saudi monarchy both of the old parties have kissed up to a terrible regime only wants to put a stop to it defend american
credible evidence leads to the inescapable conclusion that saudi agents purposely killed said libertarian national committee and phoenix mayoral candidate continues
despite this president seems unfazed even offering a appraisal of saudi crown prince mohammed bin ability to squelch dissent
surveillance footage showing a body double of khashoggi leaving the consulate suggest that the death was a premeditated murder with cover story details carefully planned
saudi officials have admitted that the journalist died in their consulate although the details of their narrative keep changing
jamal khashoggi a columnist for the washington post and resident of the united states was killed in saudi consulate in istanbul turkey on oct 2

libertarians in the other three states that did not attain party ballot access are running as independents one of the first things that libertarian party officeholders will do is liberalize ballot access laws making them fair for all
most states have ballot access laws that discriminate against any candidate running for office outside the republican or democratic parties nevertheless valiant petitioners have ensured that about 800 candidates will be on the ballot this year in 47 states + dc
first amendment actually reale said after the settlement was announced have confirmed that this soviet russia so you go after the first amendment pay the
meridien ultimately settled the case by paying $5000 to reale and $32000 to the
the city may have been motivated to avoid having mayor testify under oath reale said he was ready to ask questions like what makes you think you can just throw people out of a public park for exercising their first amendment rights like you
when the published a story about the lawsuit the city ceased stalling the case with preliminary maneuvers and switched its tactics to settlement talks
one of the effects of these unconstitutional attempts to quash the rights of the petitioners was to jeopardize ballot access in ct before the nov elections with help from the lnc however ct libertarians were able to get on the ballot in time for the midterms
desk sergeant informed him he would be arrested for criminal trespass and otherwise be put at restriction of his the complaint explained
reale hancomb followed police orders and left the park later reale called the police department to ask what would happen if they returned to continue petitioning
lawsuit alleged that the purpose of their illegal ouster from a public park was protect the d r parties from competition on the ballot in the midterm that same two parties were present and exercising their rightswithin the festival
entire interaction with the public and those who chose to sign or not sign was happy pleasant and otherwise the part of an ordinary spring day with all enjoying sunny weather and a public reale said in his complaint
access to the festival was blocked or impeded nor was any crime or disruption being reale said in his complaint
scarpati picked the wrong person to intimidate reale is not only running a libertarian campaign for office he also has a day job as a paralegal he sued representing himself
the two candidates were peacefully gathering some of their required 7500 petition signatures but mayor kevin scarpati sent in the meriden police to run them off under threat of criminal trespass for merely petitioning in a public park
