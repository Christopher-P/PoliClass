** Gather Data **
To gather users tweet data, rename the '@'s from the names list in gather data
Please be diligent about the ethical dilemmas of over-scrapping private individuals!

Require twitter api access!!

** Classification **
To classify data please utilize the classification script inside of gather data directory.
This will pull up a gui with a the political spectrum chart. The tweet data will be in the 
console window. Click on the chart to log the classification of that tweet. If the tweet
has no polticial sentiment press "SPACE" to mark it as (0,0) which will get set to 1, 1 
when normalization is run.

If the tweet contains mostly non-enlgish words or unknown symbols or does not make sense,
please press 'ESC' as this will move to the next tweet without logging it. 

To pause classification for later set the last value to whatever your tweet numbered display
console is.

** Data Generation **
Our data extension methods can be found in data generation.
Run normalize before anything else as the other scripts are dependent on the normalized data.

** Classifiers **
We utilized standard sklearn classifiers and bag of words for the results found in our paper.
Please submit generalizable classifiers here!

The data from the included classifiers were used in our final report. (plotted in libreoffice)

** Graph **
To generate the python plots, runn the python scripts inside of the graph directory.
