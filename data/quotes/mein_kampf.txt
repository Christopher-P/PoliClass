only the jew knew that by an able and persistent use of propaganda heaven itself can be presented to the people as if it were hell and vice versa the most miserable kind of life can be presented as if it were paradise the jew knew this and acted accordingly but the german or rather his government did not have the slightest suspicion of it during the war the heaviest of penalties had to be paid for that ignorance
be proud of your people when you dont have to be ashamed of any of its social classesindustry technology and commerce can thrive only as long as an idealistic national community offers the necessary preconditions and these do not lie in material egoism but in a spirit of sacrifice and joyful renunciation
then the world will be for the common people and the sounds of happiness will reach the deepest springs ah come people of every land how can you not be roused
